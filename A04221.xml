            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

that the only mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he was nowe going about, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allie troubled

nowe appeareth in the text to haue diſquieted him. Wherfore alſo he
ſaith, <hi>Father, ſaue me from this hower. Lett this cuppe paſſe from

alſo had <hi>care and compaſsion for his countreymen the Iewes?</hi> What,
if he forgot not his <hi>Apoſtles and poore Church,</hi> now to be left

troubled about his <hi>ſuffering for our ſinne.</hi> His care of his
<hi>Apoſtles and Church</hi> he vnburthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him ſelfe of, <hi>Iohn</hi> 17

victorious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of his fleſh from death was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie. As it
is written, <hi>He died for our ſinns, and roſe againe for our
iustification.</hi> But the <hi>ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed <pb n="12" facs="tcp:7944:7"/>beaſtes</hi>
neither could nor did ſignifie any ſuch thing. Therfore the

abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute redemption by Christ.</hi> They ſerued only to repreſent ſuch
partes therof as they were apt and fit to teach and ſignifie.
<hi>Secondly,</hi> I deny the <hi>aſſumption</hi> before going alſo. The
Iewes ſacrifices, that is certaine of them, did ſignifie more then the
<hi>bodily</hi> ſufferings onely, they ſet forth the ſufferinges of the

<hi>ſoule</hi> which alſo <hi>bare our ſinnes,</hi> and was a <hi>ſinne
offeringe,</hi> but yet ſuruiued and dyed not as the body of Chriſt did.
The <hi>ſcape-Goate</hi> heere ſurelie muſte of neceſſiue ſignifie
the <hi>Soule</hi> or the <hi>Deitie</hi> of Chriſt. The <hi>Deitie</hi> it
can not ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie, becauſe that can not bee a <hi>ſinne offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring.</hi>
Therefore it ſignifieth that the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall <hi>Soule</hi> of Chriſt was a
<hi>ſinne offersage:</hi> and being a ſinne offering, or a ſacrifice for
ſinne, it did properlie beare our ſinns, and ſuffer for our ſinnes.</p>
            <p>If any ſaye, <hi>This ſcape-goate</hi> ſuffered not as the
<hi>ſlayne goate</hi> did, but was <hi>ſent away</hi> free and vntouched.
Thus then the Soule of <pb n="13" facs="tcp:7944:7"/>Chriſt muſt ſcape and not
ſuffer when his body ſuffered.</p>
            <p>I aunſwere. The <hi>ſcaping</hi> of this Goate may ſignifie
the <hi>Soules immortalitie,</hi> whiche died not when the body dyed. But that
it <hi>ſuffered</hi> in that kinde which the ſoule can ſuffer, it is
manifeſt by this, that it was <hi>an offering</hi> or <hi>ſacrifice for
ſinne,</hi> and <hi>bare our ſinnes</hi> as well as the body, which is like
the ſlain Goate, whiche ſenſibly and apparauntlie died. Againe, the
ſacrifice in <hi>Leuit. chap. 6</hi> called the <hi>Holocaust,</hi> or
<hi>whole burnt offeringe,</hi> doeth liuelie prefigure the ſufferinge of the
<hi>whole Manhood</hi> of Chriſt for our ſinnes, that is both in his
ſoule and bodye. For in other ſacrifices <hi>certen partes</hi> of the
ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices were reſerued and not burnt. But in this <hi>the whole,</hi>
and euery whit being chopt and cut into pieces, it was <hi>altogither</hi> put

in the fier of affliction, as a perfect <hi>Holo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caust</hi> and a whole burnt

            <p>By this we may eaſely ſee the anſwere to a like obiection of

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> I proceed further to the ſecond proofe of this
generall reaſon: <hi>Iſay 53.10. The Lord will breake him and make him
ſubiect to infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, when he ſhall make his ſoule ſinne,</hi> that
is to ſay, a ſacrifice for ſinne. Here firſt we may note a plaine
expreſſe phraſe, the verie letter ſounding that <hi>his ſoule was
made ſinne,</hi> or a ſacrifice for ſinne: Neither is there anie vrgent
reaſon why <hi>ſoule</hi> heere should be ſo <hi>figured</hi> or
<hi>disfigured</hi> rather, that the <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane ſoule</hi> ſhould bee
wholy excluded. I denie not but <hi>his ſoule</hi> heere doeth ſignifie
<hi>him ſelfe,</hi> that is his humane nature intier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie and wholy. And that
may bee notably ſhewed by comparinge the phraſe in the Apoſtle to the
very ſame purpoſe, <hi>2. Cor. 5.21. He hath made him ſinne for vs whiche
knewe no ſinne, that we might bee made the righteouſnes of God in him.</hi>
Heere that whiche the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <pb n="15" facs="tcp:7944:8"/>meaneth ſaying, <hi>He made
his ſoule ſinne,</hi> the ſame the Apoſtle meaneth ſayinge, <hi>God
made Him ſinne for vs.</hi> That is to ſay, him ſelfe wholy as man, not
any one parte of him onelie. And this is literall. If any yet doubt, howe
Chriſt was made <hi>ſinne</hi> for vs in his ſoule, you may plainlie
ſee heere in <hi>Paule.</hi> For he compareth <hi>Christes being ſinne for
vs who knewe no ſinne, and our being the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes of God in
him,</hi>
               <note place="margin">No iuſtifying righteouſnes.</note> who haue *
no righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes in our ſelues. As if he should ſay <hi>In like
manner,</hi> He hath borne our ſinnes, as we haue receyued his
righteouſnes. But wee attaine the righteouſnes of GOD by him both in our
ſoules and bodyes: So likewiſe then, He was made ſinne for vs, both in
his ſoule &amp; body. Otherwiſe this <hi>ſimilitude</hi> or
<hi>compariſon</hi> were vneuen, and namely short on his parte, whiche ought
not to be. Therefore ſurely, <hi>he</hi> was made ſinne for vs (here in
Paule) and <hi>his ſoule</hi> was made ſinne (in Eſaie,) ſignifieth
<hi>Hee him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe</hi> was, that is intirelie in both partes he was a
ſacrifice for ſinne, euen <hi>his ſoule and body.</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> As alſo the other phraſe here in <hi>Eſay, He was broken,</hi>
doeth likewiſe prooue, as I haue enough declared thereof before.</p>
            <p>Thirdlie, I proue this generall reaſon from<note n="†" place="margin">14. Becauſe the children tooke parte of fleſh &amp; blood, he
alſo himſelf likewiſe tooke part with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that he might deſtroy

cauſe &amp; purpoſe, that he might ſuffer in that nature which he

(all men know) our humane <hi>ſoule</hi> aſwell as our fleſh, and he
ſaued our <hi>ſoule</hi> aſwell as our fleſh, <hi>ergo</hi> he
ſuffered both in <hi>ſoule</hi> and in fleſh: and the Angels nature hee
would not aſſume nor ſuffer in it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he would not ſaue it.
This reaſon is better concluded thus: If he aſſumed our whole humane
nature to this very <hi>end</hi> &amp; <hi>purpoſe</hi> that he might
ſuffer in it, and by ſuffering in it, ſaue it: then he alſo ſuffred
both in body and in <hi>ſoule.</hi> But this is true, Hee aſſumed our
whole humane nature to this verie <hi>end</hi> and <hi>purpoſe,</hi> that he
might ſuffer in it, and by ſuffering in it, ſaue it. <hi>Ergo</hi> this
is true alſo, that hee ſuffered both in <hi>ſoule</hi> and fleſhe.

Chriſt aſſumed not our nature, nor any parte of it, but onely to ſuffer

purchaſing of our redemption thereby. Otherwiſe hee had no neede to
aſſume both, but either the one parte or the other. I ſay aſ the

bene ſufficient to ſaue vs wholy, then there was no ſimple

ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. 3. His <hi>manhood</hi> here is meant his <hi>whole</hi> &amp;

&amp; body, &amp; not in one part only. But al theſe points are true, as our

Alas, we litle thinke what the bitternes of <hi>Gods wrath</hi> is, and what

The want of due knowledge and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſideration where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, I feare, is one chiefe
cauſe of broching this moſte ſhamefull quaeſtion. Rather vvee may
beeholde and ſee heere as in a glaſſe, the vnſupportable heauines and
intollerable ſmart of Gods anger for our ſinnes, which Chriſt put vpon
him ſelfe for our deliuerance: And agayne, that Chriſt became in deed <hi>a
man</hi> for vs, when as againe and againe hee could not but ſhrinke and be

            <p>Touching the firſte, Notwithſtanding all this amazednes and

ſorrowes and feares, yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained ſtill ſinneleſſe.</note> he
ſinned not. I graunt <hi>wee</hi> could not but haue ſinned in the like,
but he did not. Becauſe, euen as if you ſet two glaſſes fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, the
one with muddy water, and the other with cleere Chriſtall water, and firſte
lett them ſtande till all the muddi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in the one be ſettled at the

ſtraightway, and defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth all the water there: in the other, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though you
ſhake it neuer ſo much, yet the cleere water, though troubled like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
remayneth ſtill all cleere as chriſtal: Euen ſo if anie of vs bee
ſhaken and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted with anie trouble, our Muddy af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections ariſinge
doe preſentlie defile vs all ouer: but Chriſt (in whom was Mans true
Nature, but not anie the leaſt defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Nature) being likewiſe
ſhaken, hee remayned ſtill cleere from anie the leaſt ſpott of ſinne
at all. For to ſhunne griefe is natural in what we may: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing amazed
&amp; forgetfull, Then to ſhunne that which els we should and would
ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, is no ſinne neither, but Natures in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct. And on occaſion to
bee <hi>forgetfull,</hi> (euen as ſome<note n="*" place="margin">Marc.
13.32.</note> 
               <hi>ignorance,</hi> is not ſinne) it is Natures infirmitie, but
no ſinne. If a man indiſtreſſe fall a ſleepe, and then lift not vp
his heart to God, he ſinneth not, <pb n="57" facs="tcp:7944:30"/>nor be that being
amazed with ſome vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent blowe on the head, calleth not vpon God: becauſe
nature is oppreſſed, and can not doe that whiche hee would and ſhould
doe. Alſo in this man ſo aſtoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, or in him a ſleepe, we can not
ſaye, there is any leſſe grace: There is no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay of faith, nor of
obedience, nor of pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, nor of loue. Euen ſo in Chriſt nowe in this
caſe, there was no defect of grace, but an infirmitie of nature, which euen

his ſoule, or els <hi>by</hi> his ſoule. But both theſe are abſurd, and
moſt falſe, that Chriſt was made aliue either <hi>in</hi> his humane
Soule, or <hi>by</hi> the ſame. Therefore the <hi>Spirite</hi> heere is his
Deity, <hi>by the which</hi> after his death <hi>hee was made a liue</hi>
indeede. Againe, when ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer in Scripture the Fleſhe and the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite are

it is alwayes his Deitie. And then the <pb n="79" facs="tcp:7944:41"/>Fleſh alſo is
alwayes Chriſtes whole Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitie: I ſay not his Body only, but his Soule

               <hi>Infirmitie</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

death and crucifying. Which ſoules are ſubiect vnto and capable of, that is
the feeling of Gods wrath, as I ſhewed a little before. I ſay the reaſon
is, becauſe not one parte of Chriſtes manhood but both parts euen his whole

Therefore in this place alſo agreeably to the perpetuall vſe of the
Scripture beſides, theſe wordes <hi>Fleſh</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> ought
to ſignifie the <hi>Humane</hi> and the <hi>Diuine</hi> natures of Chriſt,
not the 2. partes of his Humanitie, his <hi>Soule</hi> and his <hi>Bodye:</hi>
ſpecially ſeeing no Circumſtance heere ouerthroweth this ſenſe, as
both before, and likewiſe preſentlie after we ſhall fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſee.
Againe, the very ſame thing is ſpoken by<note n="“" place="margin">2.
Cor. 13.4</note> 
               <hi>Paul,</hi> but more expreſlie: <hi>Hee was crueified
touching his infirmitie, but liueth by the power of God.</hi> A place moſt
excellent to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pared with this heere in <hi>Peter.</hi> That which
<hi>Peter</hi> calleth <hi>Fleſh, Paul</hi> calleth <hi>infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie,</hi> and
that whiche <hi>Peter</hi> called <hi>Spirit, Paule</hi> calleth <hi>the power
of God.</hi> That is, the one ſignifieth his <hi>whole Humanitie,</hi> both
bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye and Soule, the other his verie <hi>Deitie.</hi> And ſo by comparing
theſe two moſt like textes, our ſenſe is cleerly iuſtified.
Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, if <hi>Spirit</hi> heere ſignifie his humane <hi>Soule,</hi> then
of neceſſitie you muſt ſay, Hee was made aliue <hi>in</hi> his Soule,
or <hi>by</hi> his Soule: <hi>zôopoietheis tô pnéumati.</hi>
But both theſe are wicked and falſe to ſay: Firſt, not <hi>in</hi> his
Soule, for then his ſoule was once dead or <pb n="137" facs="tcp:7944:71"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>all at leaſt, becauſe the
word is <hi>zôopoiethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is,</hi> He was made aliue <hi>in</hi> his Soule,
beeing don to death <hi>in</hi> his body.2. Neither can it be <hi>by</hi> his
Soule, for then he liued againe <hi>by the power of his Soule,</hi> and not of
God, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che is abſurd and contrarie to many Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures before noted.
Therefore <hi>Spirit</hi> here muſt needes be the <hi>Godhead</hi> &amp;
Diuine po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of Chriſt, <hi>by the which</hi> he was in deede made aliue
after his death in his <hi>Manhood.</hi>4. If theſe wordes <hi>Fleſh</hi>
and <hi>Spirit</hi> doe ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie heere in Chriſt his <hi>Body</hi> and
<hi>Soule,</hi> then they can not beare any ſenſe but ſuch as agreeth
with all other men when they dye: to be dead in their bodies, but to liue in
their ſoules. But this text in theſe wordes ſheweth ſurelye ſome
ſingular thing happening to Chriſt, wherein hee differed from other men: as
who ſo vew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the place, may eaſilie ſee. Therefore theſe words here
do not ſignifie in Chriſt his body and ſoule, but his <hi>Manhoode</hi>

phraſe: that is <hi>compaſſed about with the earth</hi> though far from

poſſibly be meant of Chriſtes <hi>Soule going into Hell,</hi> becauſe
the Iewes heere asked Chriſt for a <hi>viſible ſigne,</hi> &amp; he
ſaid he would giue them <hi>a ſigne:</hi> that is to ſay a viſible

nights buryed in the earth, and then riſe againe to life: like Ionahs comming
againe into the world after hee had bene 3. dayes and 3. nights in the Fiſhes
belly. In this only hee would condeſcend vnto them, and giue them only this

cannot bee any going to <hi>Hell</hi> and comming thence againe: for that had
ben vtterly no <hi>viſible ſigne,</hi> neither had he anſwered any whit

alſo of that finall ſpeach of his, beeing about to ſtrike the laſte

               <hi>It is finiſhed.</hi> What is finiſhed? ſurely all that hee had to doe
with <hi>any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſary,</hi> or <hi>any contrary thing</hi> to our freedom,
euen there and then hee finiſhed it. And heereof is that vehemente<note n="“" place="margin">Ioh. 12.31.</note> ſpeach of Chriſt though
ſpoken before he was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded: <hi>Now is the iudgement of this worlde:
now ſhall the Prince of this world be caſt out.</hi> Hee ſaith <hi>caſt
out,</hi> as if hee neuer appeared any more in his ſight after that moſt
abſolute victory <hi>on the Croſſe:</hi>

ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth in this place, as<note n="†" place="margin">Pag. 61.</note>
before wee haue ſeene. Thus then appeareth plainly this doctrine, that
<hi>Chriſt on the Croſſe</hi> did all and euery one of his victorious
actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s againſt Satha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; wrought meritoriouſly our full deliuerance
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, ſo that no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ot
of his right nor power againſt vs remayned af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that, but there <hi>hee
ſpoyled him,</hi> there <hi>hee confidently triumphed,</hi> and <hi>made a
ſhew openly of him,</hi> and trode him vnder foote for euer: he ſo beate
him &amp; ſo deſtroyed his power <pb n="159" facs="tcp:7944:84"/>that there was no
feare y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> any thing ſhuld once ſtirre againſt him or vs afterward. This
is meant by <hi>Chriſtes triumphing on the Croſſe.</hi> For els indeed a
pitions triumph it was, where himſelfe remayned in ſuch wofull torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts,
where appeared no ſhew of conqueſt, but rather of being conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
Therefore this is ſpoken <hi>in regard of the effect</hi> which came of this
action,<note place="margin">His triumph on the Croſſe was in regard of the
effect whiche it wrought.</note> not of the ſimple action (or rather
<hi>paſsion</hi>) it ſelf. What <hi>effect? An effect</hi> rare and
ſtrange, nothing like, yea contrarie to that which happeneth in like caſe
amongſt men. When they in fight are beaten, &amp; woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and ſlaine,
they are conquered: but Chriſt euen in beeing beaten, and woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and
ſlaine, therein hee conquered, and triumphed, and led openlie his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies in
captiuitie. Nowe hee ſaith <hi>openly,</hi> not that Chriſte did this
openly and eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently to our ſenſes, but alluding to the maner of
conquerours in their trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phes, who lead in <hi>open ſhew</hi> thoſe
enemyes which henceforth cannot once ſtrirre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them any more: ſo
hee ſignifieth that the <hi>effect of Chriſtes very death</hi> was ſuch
and ſo forcible indeede, and fully to bee compared with theſe doings of
<hi>perfect con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querours:</hi> and therefore moſt <hi>emphatically</hi> he
ſetteth it out in theſe termes.</p>
            <p>Thus farre this doctrine is iuſtifyed of <hi>Christes triumphing
on the Croſſe,</hi> howſoeuer the reading be in thoſe laſt words of

<hi>Articles</hi> both before and after this. His <hi>Dying, Buriall,</hi> and

who did but newlie peepe out of Poperie. But our Synode ſince correcteth it
